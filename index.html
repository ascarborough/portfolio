    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    <p>My name is Abigail Marie Scarborough. I am near finishing my senior year at Eastern Washington University. I am gaining my B.A. in Technical Communcation with a minor in Viusal Communcation Design. My intended graduation date is Summer 2017. Over my schooling, I have gained a strong passion for both writing and design. I hope to continue to excel in both these areas with the completion of my degree and professional workforce experience.</p>
    <p>I currently am employed at my university, where I work in the theatre department of Eastern Washington University. I am tasked with designing, building, and maintaining all costumes used for EWU theatre productions. As fun as this job may be, it is had taught me to keep on my toes as changes can happen quickly and things sometimes don't work out as planned - so you must be able to rethink and try new things all the time to accomplish certain tasks.</p>
    <p>I am 22 years old, and have lived in the small town of Nine Mile Falls, Washington all my life. I enjoy art, literature, baking, and pet blogging.</p>
    <p>Please explore my site. You can view both my resume and professional portfolio.</p>
