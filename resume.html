  <p>I am currently a senior at Eastern Washington University and will graduate in Summer 2017 with a BA degree in Technical Communcations and a minor in Visual Communcation Design (just a fancy name for graphic design). Along, with an emphasis in Public Relations. I have lived in Washington State my entire life, growing up in the small community of Nine Mile Falls.

Some of my other passions include literature, photography, and pet blogging.  </p>
